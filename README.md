# Sports_and_Injuries


### Part 1: Blood
The goal is to compare sampled and hypothesized proportions of blood types for people undergoing a specific surgical procedure. We will summarize the data, test a hypothesized set of population proportions, create and interpret confidence intervals, and note any outcomes of interest. 

### Part 2: Sports and Injury
The goal of this project is to explore the relationship between injuries and sport chosen using a random sample of 488 athletes. We will summarize the data, perform a Pearsonâ€™s hypothesis test, and form pairwise confidence intervals in order to analyze the data and reach our conclusions.
